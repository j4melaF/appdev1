# Cloud Computing

## Purpose
**Cloud computing** allows individuals and organizations to access computer services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and applications through the internet. Users can store and manage data on remote servers, which can be reached from any device with an internet connection, instead of maintaining their own physical infrastructure. This method provides greater flexibility, scalability to meet changing needs, and lower costs since there's no need to buy or maintain on-site equipment. It also makes collaboration easier, enables faster deployment of applications, and promotes more efficient resource use.

## Usage
- **In Education**:  
  With cloud computing, schools may easily access IT resources like servers, software, networking, databases, and storage. This contributes to classrooms that are linked and modern. It can be used by educational institutions for virtual classrooms, online assessments, enrollment, and learning management. Additionally, it facilitates collaboration between educators and learners, allows access to lessons at any time, and save money by reducing the need for expensive equipment.
